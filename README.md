# [CalKeeper App](https://lastnamearya.github.io/CalKeeper-App/)

I built this [app](https://lastnamearya.github.io/CalKeeper-App/) in pure regular JavaScript without using any framework or library No compiling and No build-tools, I used JavaScript Modules architecture in my app. I also used LocalStorage API to presist local data. It's the first version of my app, Later I'll add 
more functionality. Current functionalities my app offer:- 

- Add Meals and Calories
- Update Meals / Calories
- Delete Meals
- Reset Everything on clicking Clear All Button
- App-Data is stored under LocalStorage so on page-reloads, stored data is saved across browser sessions.
